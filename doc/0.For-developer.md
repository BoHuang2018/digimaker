Some principles
----------------

It should NOT block developer to use entry part(in php it's index.php), meaning the developer should be able to embed the system into another system by using api. In general, a developer can extend/customize in different level:
 - invoke the system in go API
 - being invoked in go API(plugin)
 - Template override and extending
 - Config of course
 - Rest api of course
