Basic way to do administration
===============

### Model change(content type change)
Unlike some other cms, this framework needs technical people to do model change, so everything which is for advanced editor's part should be implemented in editor part, eg. options for select datatype in a content type.

This part can be hidden from editor's view completely, or create a special role for maintenancer. In that case administrator is the editor administrator, who doesn't have access to model change either.

Content type model change will
- trigger generating orm enities.
- create a sql for administrator to execute(or execute online), but will not execute it automatically.
- need to regenerate orm and maybe others after execution.
- never delete column or table automatically.

maintenancer
------
- should be possible to add user from command line. eg.
 - ./user list,
 - ./user add testadmin test@111 --firstname="Test" --lastname="Test Last"
 - ./user changepassword testadmin test@222
 - ./user generate-password
- put maintaincer(username, password hash) into config file? only those users in the list can come to administrator ui. So it will be 2 user system but sharing one password generating library.


Applications
------
Typical applications can be:
- editorial system
- sub sites
- sub site editorial(can be together with previous)
- workflow system
- dm administration console

So the framework aim to support multiple applications, and each application has proper ui. The permission system should be able to cope all modules/ui related to all applications.
user->roles->policy->limitations

3 issues:
- when assign role to user group/user with subtree, it's bit strange since module/view doesn't have subtree.
- if a user can access to feature, he should be able to access in all applications if it exists there.
- can it be easier to differenciate editorial administrator and system administrator for permission assignment.

So how to make role assignment easier for editorial administrator without knowing technical things?
- Roles should be under organization/department/usergroup? eg. Role Dev Engineer's access are under R&D department.
