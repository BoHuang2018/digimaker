This is a progress notes noting down what's important in different stages, in case of losing concentration or forgetting about things.

Concentration
--------------
Now(phrase1):
 - Model, Database API,
   - common components: log, error type, db interface, config
   - db/SQL & db/RMDB: make query generic for all types
   - api/query style with some working well
   - config with siteaccess(toml or yaml - maybe yaml?)
 - Create content
 - Text & rich text data type
 - Local api
 - Rest Api
 - Permission
 - Example of using

Next:
 - Template with Override rule
 - More operations. eg. copy, move

Next next:
 - Admin ui


Progress Log
---------
**April Week1**
1) db generic query, not use sqlboiler struct query, but use sqlboiler raw since we need all query dynamic
2) Example of db query by fields array
3) Think about query api style
4) Confirm query style, at least for conditions. Create query syntax analyser to build structs

**April Week2**
1) Create rbmb QueryBuilder based on analysed structs
2) Enhance week1's 2) based on 1)
3) Idea of unique id, use it for cluster, also for internal use(internal link typically, where we don't maintain when id is changed because of migration for instance/partition moving/cluster). Plan next: entity update, insert, delete, operation relation between content and location, so we can start content action(draft, publish, edit, delete, move, etc).

[April 13]
- Idea of draft, store with dynamic field( eg. article.SetField( <identifier>, value )). What parameter format can be in api?
  - Way 1: use SetField( <identifier>, value ), in addtional to article.<Attribute> = value
  - Way 2: use marshall for updating/setting attribute?

- Current&next: everything from a request to saving, including
  - simple mvc
  - error handling,
  - dynamic parameter format
  - events before/after action
  - default thing in setting, eg. section, language
  - permission check interface
  - different setting based on site

- Next/next next:
  - field types
  - mechanism of generating & building online
  - rest API about authentication(maybe simple first)
  - template&more query format
  - simple client ui, then(phrase 2):
  - more field types
  - content types(including users)
  - more permission
  - images/files
  - online editor

[April 14]

Is DTO needed? I guess not needed in core, since the field can be changed quite often, you basically have to generate a layer of dto based on definition. In addition, you still need to support DTO visit dynamically. In the end the DTO value is set by a json like format. And we don't use DTO anywhere else. So we can have a "layer of DTO concept based on definition structs and map instances, but no struct generated", where validation will be based on that rule.

[April 15]

putting datatype into entity level might be too low level, it makes it hard to operate(eg. output value when doing sql debug) since it's a struct not basic type like string. It should be a good idea to put most of logic into business logic level.

DataType/FieldType can be in these:
- struct TextField{ viewValue string, storeValue string, definition DataTypeSetting  }
  - convertToView( storedValue string )
  - SetStorageValue( storedValue string ) which invoke converting to view value
  - ViewValue()
  - StorageValue()
There should be an interface for it. eg. FieldType{ ViewValue(), StoredValue() }


One problem becomes, how to easily access value? If it's in database field type, you can get it from entity(eg. <article>.Title will return a TextField Instance), while here it only return a string. Possible way to solve it:

- way1: use one new struct TextFieldStorage which will be used for db. TextFieldStorage has a method called ViewValue() which get view value(which can be struct also)

- way2: Use a converter. eg. convert.ToViewValue( <article>.Title ) will get the view value. In this way the style is function-like instead of OO-like. How is it in template.

The point comes to how to layer this. way1 is more api-nice, but might be against layer(putting too much logic into database level)? way2 has clear separation and might be good for flexiablity(which is a benefit of separated layer)(eg. for extneded normal db field also). But there should be well balanced between these 2.

[April 15 afternoon]

For now we separate in 2 layers:
 - storage entity(eg. TextField) including conversion to view value
 - handler(eg. TextFieldHandler) including conversion to storage value and validation.
The storage is part of storage layer and handler is part of business layer. If there is change on archecture, we may have a dto(view enities) layer for long term. In that case, storage can be pure string, while all the conversion will be on "view entity" level.

[April 17]
Plan for next weeks(eg. 4 weeks)
- handler for create, update, delete
- loader callback mechanism
- queries & template use in query including caches
- permission and apply it to all actions
- rest api(it will be a natural wrap after handlers are done)
- simple editorial ui(will not release, but for demo purpose)

After that
- Generate database, entities based on configuration
- more field types
- admin ui for backend

[April 19]
Something about auto generating:
- It will be hard to add code based on auto generating(better to use partial struct for go?). So the core shouldn't be generated?
- For content types, should it be generated by orm or own generator? benefits to use own generator
   - it can be generated from program using go generate or write to file directly so the setting is totally dynamic(eg. mapping) without generating any middle file
   - more flexiable control(direct mapping on table level)
   - performance better
   - error handle better

[April 21]
Properties in ContentCommon can be in a separate table, or in location if needed.
