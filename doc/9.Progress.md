This is a progress notes noting down what's important in different stages, in case of losing concentration or forgetting about things.

Concentration
--------------
Now(phrase1):
 - Model, Database API,
   - common components: log, error type, db interface, config
   - db/SQL & db/RMDB: make query generic for all types
   - api/query style with some working well
   - config with siteaccess(toml or yaml - maybe yaml?)
 - Create content
 - Text & rich text data type
 - Local api
 - Rest Api
 - Permission
 - Example of using

Next:
 - Template with Override rule
 - More operations. eg. copy, move

Next next:
 - Admin ui


Progress Log
---------
**April Week1**
1) db generic query, not use sqlboiler struct query, but use sqlboiler raw since we need all query dynamic
2) Example of db query by fields array
3) Think about query api style
4) Confirm query style, at least for conditions. Create query syntax analyser to build structs

**April Week2**
1) Create rbmb QueryBuilder based on analysed structs
2) Enhance week1's 2) based on 1)
3) Idea of unique id, use it for cluster, also for internal use(internal link typically, where we don't maintain when id is changed because of migration for instance/partition moving/cluster). Plan next: entity update, insert, delete, operation relation between content and location, so we can start content action(draft, publish, edit, delete, move, etc).

[April 13]
- Idea of draft, store with dynamic field( eg. article.SetField( <identifier>, value )). What parameter format can be in api?
  - Way 1: use SetField( <identifier>, value ), in addtional to article.<Attribute> = value
  - Way 2: use marshall for updating/setting attribute?

- Current&next: everything from a request to saving, including
  - simple mvc
  - error handling,
  - dynamic parameter format
  - events before/after action
  - default thing in setting, eg. section, language
  - permission check interface

- Next/next next:
  - field types
  - mechanism of generating & building online
