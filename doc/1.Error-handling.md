Why need different error type?
-------
In our system, it's a way differentiate different error levels, or a way for errors which need to be handled differently.

eg.
- Low level error: Database error, config error, query error
- Content error: content not found, Note: input validation is not an error here.
- Content handling error: draft, publish

Question: how to handle different level together with error types, error code and log, and DO NOT create unnecessary error types(then you need a lot of switch err.type)?

There are cases that you don't need to return error, but return nil
