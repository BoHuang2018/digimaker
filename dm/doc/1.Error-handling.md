Why need different error type?
-------
In our system, it's a way differentiate different error levels, or a way for errors which need to be handled differently.

eg.
- Low level error: Database error, config error, query error
- Content error: content not found, Note: input validation is not an error here.
- Content handling error: draft, publish

Question: how to handle different level together with error types, error code and log, and DO NOT create unnecessary error types(then you need a lot of switch err.type)?

There are cases that you don't need to return error, but return nil

Error code
----------
When it comes to public api, rest api, controller(eg. no access.),  centralized error handling(eg. error page, error handler in controller), an error code is needed. But looks error code is mostly for different platform(eg. between go and template, between go and js(rest) ), otherwise, error mechanisim in go should be good enough to track/catagorize errors like exception(and simplaer and more useful).
