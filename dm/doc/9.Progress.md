This is a progress notes noting down what's important in different stages, in case of losing concentration or forgetting about things.

Concentration
--------------
Now(phrase1):
 - Model, Database API,
   - common components: log, error type, db interface, config
   - db/SQL & db/RMDB: make query generic for all types
   - api/query style with some working well
   - config with siteaccess(toml or yaml - maybe yaml?)
 - Create content
 - Text & rich text data type
 - Local api
 - Rest Api
 - Permission
 - Example of using

Next:
 - Template with Override rule
 - More operations. eg. copy, move

Next next:
 - Admin ui


Progress Log
---------
**April Week1**
1) db generic query, not use sqlboiler struct query, but use sqlboiler raw since we need all query dynamic
2) Example of db query by fields array
3) Think about query api style
4) Confirm query style, at least for conditions. Create query syntax analyser to build structs

**April Week2**
1) Create rbmb QueryBuilder based on analysed structs
2) Enhance week1's 2) based on 1)
3) Idea of unique id, use it for cluster, also for internal use(internal link typically, where we don't maintain when id is changed because of migration for instance/partition moving/cluster). Plan next: entity update, insert, delete, operation relation between content and location, so we can start content action(draft, publish, edit, delete, move, etc).

[April 13]
- Idea of draft, store with dynamic field( eg. article.SetField( <identifier>, value )). What parameter format can be in api?
  - Way 1: use SetField( <identifier>, value ), in addtional to article.<Attribute> = value
  - Way 2: use marshall for updating/setting attribute?

- Current&next: everything from a request to saving, including
  - simple mvc
  - error handling,
  - dynamic parameter format
  - events before/after action
  - default thing in setting, eg. section, language
  - permission check interface
  - different setting based on site

- Next/next next:
  - field types
  - mechanism of generating & building online
  - rest API about authentication(maybe simple first)
  - template&more query format
  - simple client ui, then(phrase 2):
  - more field types
  - content types(including users)
  - more permission
  - images/files
  - online editor

[April 14]

Is DTO needed? I guess not needed in core, since the field can be changed quite often, you basically have to generate a layer of dto based on definition. In addition, you still need to support DTO visit dynamically. In the end the DTO value is set by a json like format. And we don't use DTO anywhere else. So we can have a "layer of DTO concept based on definition structs and map instances, but no struct generated", where validation will be based on that rule.

[April 15]

putting datatype into entity level might be too low level, it makes it hard to operate(eg. output value when doing sql debug) since it's a struct not basic type like string. It should be a good idea to put most of logic into business logic level.

DataType/FieldType can be in these:
- struct TextField{ viewValue string, storeValue string, definition DataTypeSetting  }
  - convertToView( storedValue string )
  - SetStorageValue( storedValue string ) which invoke converting to view value
  - ViewValue()
  - StorageValue()
There should be an interface for it. eg. FieldType{ ViewValue(), StoredValue() }


One problem becomes, how to easily access value? If it's in database field type, you can get it from entity(eg. <article>.Title will return a TextField Instance), while here it only return a string. Possible way to solve it:

- way1: use one new struct TextFieldStorage which will be used for db. TextFieldStorage has a method called ViewValue() which get view value(which can be struct also)

- way2: Use a converter. eg. convert.ToViewValue( <article>.Title ) will get the view value. In this way the style is function-like instead of OO-like. How is it in template.

The point comes to how to layer this. way1 is more api-nice, but might be against layer(putting too much logic into database level)? way2 has clear separation and might be good for flexiablity(which is a benefit of separated layer)(eg. for extneded normal db field also). But there should be well balanced between these 2.

[April 15 afternoon]

For now we separate in 2 layers:
 - storage entity(eg. TextField) including conversion to view value
 - handler(eg. TextFieldHandler) including conversion to storage value and validation.
The storage is part of storage layer and handler is part of business layer. If there is change on archecture, we may have a dto(view enities) layer for long term. In that case, storage can be pure string, while all the conversion will be on "view entity" level.

[April 17]
Plan for next weeks(eg. 4 weeks)
- handler for create, update, delete
- loader callback mechanism
- queries & template use in query including caches
- permission and apply it to all actions
- rest api(it will be a natural wrap after handlers are done)
- simple editorial ui(will not release, but for demo purpose)

After that
- Generate database, entities based on configuration
- more field types
- admin ui for backend

[April 19]
Something about auto generating:
- It will be hard to add code based on auto generating(better to use partial struct for go?). So the core shouldn't be generated?
- For content types, should it be generated by orm or own generator? benefits to use own generator
   - it can be generated from program using go generate or write to file directly so the setting is totally dynamic(eg. mapping) without generating any middle file
   - more flexiable control(direct mapping on table level)
   - performance better
   - error handle better

[April 20]
Properties in ContentCommon can be in a separate table, or in location if needed.

[April 21]
Next is to finish the ContentHandler.Create() with all dynamic meaning
- Get content type dynamically, which return a ContentTyper
- Dynamically set field eg. content.SetValue( "title", <titleField> ). There may be put in interface ContentTyper.
- So the set value can be set on ContentCommon also since it's a interface and you don't know the ContentCommon

[April 22]
Array of interface is very strange. eg. []Content ,converting instance to it is very difficult, you don't know if you get a value(struct) or a pointer(pointer of the value). If it's from pointer list, it's impossible to convert to this list(you will get a list of pointer which points to the same place).

[April 23]
Content relations, images/videos, attribute relations
- cover images should be saved inside article attribute(either url or image id(use dm_image table for storing all content images(article's cover image, image content, slide shows ). columns can be "id",  "content_type", "url", "uid", "created_time", "modified_time")). There is a centralize place to mangage images attributes - not only image object!
- content relations should use dm_relations table. eg. transations will be using 'transation' relation type
- attribute relation can use content relations(use identifier ), or attribute stored relations(eg. slides:[{id:<location_id1>, name: xxxx},{id:<location_id2>, name:xxxx}]) - not decided yet. On content level it's hard to get list of relations in one attribute.

There is a principle for relations: if it's clear structure(you know where to fetch), it can be done in content level, otherwise store into fields because it will be much better to fetch content list with relation.

How about using both? relations is to keep relations, attribute is to have a "cache" of the relation so it's easier to update. Or use json type in mysql(after version 5.7) or viturl json type(how is the performance?).

[Update]
It might be good to keep both dm_relation and dm_article.relation. The more convenient is use dm_article.relation only for normal relation, to track relation change and more query based on relation, the dm_relation table should be useful(actually mysql json's virtual column can help here in some way. eg. responsible_editor can be a virtual column of relations, and it can support being used as query condition(for reverse query: articles where responsible_editor equals xxxx), the problem is that multiple value responsible_editors is not supported as virtual column ).


[April 24]

The current structure has a presumption that "you know the type before you query", this is fine for direct query, what about indirect query. eg when using relations:
- get an list of article where its related_person is from Norway(article->related_person field->person->country). This is possible since we know it's person.
- What if it's from multi type. eg.

Content model
- 1) [content model]The structure of content table with content_field table may have some benefit, but it will make join with other table very wire. eg. "SELECT * FROM content, content_field, booking WHERE content_field.id = content.id and content_field.identifier ='booking_id'" and booking.id = content_field.value
- 2) [content model] or use content&article_field/folder_field combination, this will make join nicer, but not nice as complete article table. But it will make the common condition query easier(published, modified..). Note: if content is put as common table, it will make it hard to relate to normal table(eg. bookings).
- 3) [content model] put the comment field into location(and rename it to content). In that case, the preassumption becomes "you know the type before you query specific attribute"
- 4) [entities]maybe use a map[<field name>]FieldType so there is no need to generate entities.
- 5) There are 2 types of content: content having location(eg. article, folder) and content having no location(eg. images. They just need parent location they can hook under)
- 6) There are 2 types of relations: relation to location, relation to content.

Now it's "SELECT * FROM content_x booking WHERE content_x.booking_id = booking.id"

Again, the core of content model are locations->contents->relations, contents can be any contents, possibally another new table "eg. order/booking". Relation will play a very important role for extending.

See 0.content-extended-content-relations.png for clarification. Keep 2 things in mind
- Is it needed to abstract content into a separate table(balance easiablity(one table for id name, modified) and extendability( relation can be used for custom contents like booking ) )?
- How to use uid properly. Link? yes. other senario?(relation? no, hard to read id)

[April 25]
There are 2 kinds of relations: attribute level(eg. related links) and content level(eg. translation). It might be more generic that if we have all in attribute level, but just not create cache(eg. called virtual relations). In this case translation is an virtual relation where nor-no is the relatio(n data.

In additional to translation, there are more virtual relation fields, eg. orders: so if there are orders put into relation table. Basically relation table can be treat like normal other relation tables.

Potentially it can be more relation table, based on relation types. But so far it's good for now.

Question: do we need to define this virtual relation field or just leave it in table?
I think it's needed since it define how the relation data is defined and update.

Last: maybe it's better to put relation field into relation table so it's easier to do update. Group_Concat is useful when doing query.

And this relation is mainly for content related, for other case, create own relation table. eg. user's booking better to be in another table, instead of creating a bookings relation field in user. otherwise the table will be very big!

[April 26]
- [Relation]Embeded content will be possible together with relation. eg. for editors list, you can add name, email, but don't create user(and you can choose use also). In this case there will be data merge between "relation data" and "embed content data" and priority matters for both. THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR NOW. VERY FEW CASES NEED MERGING(you can just implement as a normal field with some prompt out help when typing).
- [Operation log]Support operation logs, eg. when editing, when add relation, etc.

[April 29]
 The common content table can be called dm_content_meta instead of dm_content_common, since it is a meta data table. published, modified, author? The question comes to if it's needed to have this table, since we assume "you know type before you query", in that case
 - separate meta data with content data make it hard to maintain(eg. update content, query(you need to know if you are querying with data or meta data) ).  
 - hard to look(maybe not that much hard), since you need to query 2 tables to get content data?
 - the good thing is that, common attribute query is much easier(eg. basic content info in latest 1 month).
 - How about non location content, eg. images, links. Those content better to have all in one table.
dm_content_meta( id(not used?), content_id, content_type, author, published, modified, language )

 So there are 3 ways:
 - cache it in location
 - create a common table called dm_content_meta
 - keep it as now where all contents have meta column included and cache some in location(eg. author).

#### [April 30]
 Next: Count, list of content, delete(including trash), edit, save draft.

 Next next: rest api.

#### [May 1]
The framework should support import&export well(eg. in json format) and easily via eg. command line. While the more common import is for set up(content types, initial structure for different applications ). In this case, uid is import. In this context, also idea is that, you can clean it if it failed to import(eg. because of naming conflict) or it needs strong validation first.

PS.the current content model make it much easier to do import. any more about model can be optimized for import/export?

**So maybe relation should use uid instead of id. or we can just generate id after that, which is less nice.** If we use uid, it will make import quite easy. The model and datatype import should be done separately since model needs db table creating, which can have failure, datatype needs code checkout, which should be done from command line.

It should be backward compatable, meaning newer data can be imported to older model.

So import & export can be used for
- Setup for product. eg. if there is editorial ui, which needs contenttype set up. datatype should be done like library.
- Project migration. eg. separate/merge data in different installations(but same model).

In that case nice url might be a separate module, not the core(eg.xxx/yyy/zzz-12212 works already in mvc, xxx/yyy/zzz can be a plus).


**It should allow regular type(eg. int, string) in content type, not only custom datatype** It will be empty if not set.

#### [May 2nd]
About normal content. it should have common interface to query, ui for listing.

It will be more thinking to use
- a common folder or new container(eg. image container). It's easier to api query if it's a new type, but also can be not necessary to have all new if it's just a name for the container(eg. team/user group). Also it creates more work for configuring, template, permission setting, import(need new content type) and debug query in db directly(might be better to query since dm_usergroup can be easier to query than dm_folder with folder_type usergroup ). Need to think more and also it's a job in solution.
- a new container or a special type under folder(eg. frontpage should be a container or a content under <site> folder).


Image alias
- Image alias should be generated only when it's requested, thumbnail can be generated when uploading. This will save a lot of space. And when we migrate images, we only migrate original version.
    The reason is for space, also image alias are very unpredictable, it's quite common that many alias is added later(eg. for coverimage, user profile). So when uploading, only fixed alias(typical thumnail) will be generated.
        -  we don't want to use image/view/<image uid> to view because it's not good for seo
        - also we don't want .jpg handler comes through business logic since business logic is less reliable that static hosting(and image may host separately in apache/nigix).
        - we want var/images/xxxd/test1.jpg) at the same time it can be authenticated.
        - maybe a authentication code between business and image hosting. eg./<authentication code>/var/xxx/this-is-good-news.jpg, and /var/xxx/this-is-good-news.jpg works if it's open for anonymous. Same mechanism for documents. Check how cdn authentication works for images.


Current concentration is still content model include content types, handlers in query add/edit/delete/draft, etc.
Next will come to specific feature for admin/editorial ui.


How can trash be implemented? via section, partition, in different table, or minus(see previous idea about partition in contentmodel.md)?

#### [May 4th]
Debug: high level error can be put into request(at same time in log file).
How about debug info in low level, eg. sql output. Is there a way to output to client instead of system?
Putting context to everywhere(and just for log purpose) is still too much. There should be a simpler way.

For now it outputs db debug into file/std. Keep in mind about ways to optimize this.

#### [May 5th]
Ideally no context debug(eg. db debug) and context debug(eg. logic, module) can be in one. hope there is a way to fix this(eg. log based on ip? but then global variable of ips may be needed).

**Draft**
Draft feature: dm_draft can be used as a draft saving. the data is similar to data in dm_version. It's used for auto-saving for ANY FORM, including create/edit content, customzied form, or integration with 3rd party(eg web service).

So all the draft will be saved to dm_draft, including when you modify, version will not save any draft. There is a special "shared draft" status, which is not needed in most case. In this way version can be used for serious workflow editing(eg. approve a content, you create a pending version of a content, and shared comment, change content and send to approval based on version, and you can reopen it. ) by adding more tables. By default version is created only when it's sent to publish.

next:
- finish version(use tag to serialize )
- create content together with edit(and callback mechanism)


#### [May 8th]
Current: finish creating&update about relations, version, generic serilization(typically for import and export)
Next: callback mechanism in handler(nice url can be a module?), trash
Modules: There should be a way to include&exclude some modules to default package. (something similar to apache/chrome that you have plan to include/exclude package, instead of keep all inside and hard to remove after time. This will make sure the package always has best&flexiable modules)
- niceurl(maybe in website-pack or build-in). use it in website.
    - (powerful url that keeps the old url event if renamed)
    - support pattern(with or without id like xxx-112, unicode with id)
    - niceurlize: when you enable, you can make all content with nice url
- image service

Packages:
 - website packages: including editorial ui, templating kit, multi-site support.
 - document system package(eg. ): workflow approval. No-nice url module needed(it slows down and you need to maintain the niceurl from different application)

Permission: Permission should be able to control to field level. This is useful for multi-sites, eg. if a site editor(specially for small site) wants to change logo - we only allow him to change logo, nothing else.

#### [May 9th]
Different between a new contenttype or a existing with a new field:
- a new type is easier to filter by, template override, but not query

- new type might be hard to configure in term of. eg. allowed_types. eg. for new contentyper.
  - folder_media->allowed_types: image, file
  - folder->allowed_types: {"content":["article", "folder"],
                            "image":["image"],
                            "file":["file"],
                            "site":["folder", "article", "frontpage"]}.
    This can be generic if filter is "<contentype>\_type" is "content"|"image"|"file"

  - Benefit of using one content type is that it's easy to set up(no model change needed). model->query,handler->ui/rest and permission, but they you might need to query by specific field(eg. folder_type?) I guess most of cases when there is a need to query multiple folder_types, it should query all folders(eg. under site to query image folder, file folder, content folder).

  - Another way can be supporting extending but used same table.(eg. folder->folder_image|folder_site|folder_user).

So the principle should be balancing new contenttype or new type of a <contentype>\_type(eg: folder_type). If they are conceptally similar they might be in one type(eg. folder: content, folder: image, etc. or use resources(type can be image/file) ), but if they have complete different usage: might be better to use a new contenttype(eg. user_group since it can be used for permission set up and better query filter).

so
- folder: folder_type: content, folder_type: community(if content is about community under)
- menu: menu_type: file, menu_type: image, menu_type: order, menu_type: draft_list(my draft list). (menu is used for non-location content)
- usergroup:

Something factors on contenttype or new folder_type like:
- query. query one type or multiple
- allowed_types setting
- permission setup. contentype is easier, but too many contenttype for similar permission can be complicated
- ui. (will be hard to hide a folder_type, easier to hide a contenttype)

#### [May 10th]
Import
- can support reverting(unimport), so it will be good to try some package data.
- there can be remote_id from
TODO:
- generate non-version content type
- no view type(eg. string instead of fieldtype.text)
- relation uid, json
- import
- import script.
- init test from import data.

#### [May 11th]
Difference between interface and struct with function field:
- struct is simpler if you don't want to create a struct for the interface, since in the implementation part you can just <structName>{ Callback: func(){...} }. It's good when the interface implementation is only once and more generic(eg. a more generic method instead serveal with different type). This is similar to jquery.ajax callback.
- interface is more organized but creating a struct and register can be sometimes overengineered.

style 1(deligation):
public MainWindow()
   {
       // This button needs to exist on your form.
       myButton.Click += myButton_Click;
   }

   void myButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
   {
       MessageBox.Show("Message here");
       this.Close();
   }

style2:
public MainWindow()
{
   // This button needs to exist on your form.
   myButton.Click(function(){
       MessageBox.Show("Message here");
       this.Close();       
       });
}

style2 is more readable when in ui, because it follows a principle: do NOT create function when not needed because it breaks the read flow.

#### [May 13th]
Export can cope different cases:
Migration:
- data export&import for migration
- data export & import for sync between 2 installations, or between live and dev
Export for end user-3rd party:
- data export for data exchange. eg. 3rd party import
- data export for download, eg. csv/excel.

They will have one core format, which is json. The format for end user/3rd part can be more "user friend"(eg. location tag is not needed and group by content type)

### [May 27th]
Permission terms:
- policy consists of permissions
- permission: module, action, limitation
- policy can be assigned to user&user group with access tree or scope.

should we rename policy to access? or role? maybe not


### [May 30th]
Tree or assignment between user and user group? The principle is that, proper model is important, not overengineered and not lessengineered.
Tree:
  - can reuse structure and action eg. create, edit, delete
  - support inheritance between groups, but maybe not needed in most of cases
  - support inheritance between group and user so you don't need to set group every time, in this case group is both a category and permission group.[important]
  - can see permission easily in most cases because tree shows some kind of "permission group"
  - can change permission easily

Assignment:
  - can still use structure and action, but user groups will be an field/relation


### [June 3th]
Simplicity: keep term policy, role/usergroup supporting inheritance, user, organization structure. That's all. we don't need both role and usergroup, if role/usergroup supports inhertance and assign with subtree/scope, it should be enough.

In most cases, a user only needs to assigned to one usergroup/role, unless 2 roles are in equal level(eg. a member is also an editor). If a user is assigned to several roles which has much in common, there might be something wrong with the role.

The key is that, when you see a user's policy list, it shouldn't be much "junction records".


Sometimes we need to use structure for other purpose. eg. a user's parent might has organization no. These should be done in the organization strcuture, not user group/role structure.

Question: should we use tree or assignment between role(a combination of role and user groups) and user?
tree:
- easier to organize and implement

assignment:
- more natual

The thing is that if we implement organization structure in tree and assignment will be difficult to implement, same if we use tree for assignment. What if we use tree for both?(so a user will have multiple locations, one group for organization, one group for role assignment). Maybe have a field called "parent_type(eg. organization/permission)"

### [June 7th]
Next put permission into logic.
- query: subtree, list
- action: new, edit, delete

### [June 9th]
We should try to avoid using subtree limitation for content/read, because it's hard to do listing/subtree,
Current: fix list issue to implement subtree. then more permission on edit/delete/etc

### [June 10th]
Current: set policies and implement new/edit/delete.
Big next: ui for all

### [June 11th]
Should we use more content types or common content type with different subtype? Some factors need to be considered:
- allowed type needs more implementation. when type is images, allow type can be only images.
- query: same type is good for mixed query(just relatively good).
- permission:if same type is used, permission needs to be in field level. (eg. edit/create/read media type)

This can be decided later after having more scenarios. If it's all type based, we just need a 'sub type' configuration for ui.

The purpose is to have a 'close to perfect' model that use only focus on the his content, at the same time the system is smooth with the model(eg. try to use less content types).

### [June 13th]
code formalize:
- schema
- init data
- test data
- test init

Next: verify tests and make it more formal.

## [June 16th]
Template: for first try-project, we can just use go template engine, but definitely we will need a professional template engine with more template widget/api for professional sites.

Rest API &Admin: can use rest api, make it possible to embed to frontend.

How to implement frontend editing?
- standard editing: everything can be done from a menu and one site editing can have all features of a scope(including permission setting related to this scope)
- embed editing: one should be able to choose embed editing for popup editing. Some markup in design is needed to implement this.
- back end(project)

## [June 17th]
See [Editorial-ui.md](1.Editorial-ui.md) for editorial user interface ideas.

Routing: we should allow routing based on prefix. prefix can be prefix, site identifier, and we can set which module is visible for which router(eg. usergroup/assign/1 might not be accessable to all - here router does something similar to permission, but more clean).

## [June 18th]
Routing: there are several routings:
- view content: this will be done together with nice url and template override rules(website toolkit). routing is only for viewing content.
- manage content(eui): this will be done by angular and rest. routing work is mainly for rest.
- extending site: mainly in rest. client routing can be done by customer.

An important principle is that, the core should use as less routing as possible, so it will give more flexibility to the project for suitable url/load balance/multi sites.

Template engine: for professional site, the default html template is too simple.
- doesn't support include dynamically(you always need to tell parser which file to parse, while parsing all files can be costly). This will be very hard to implement a facebook.tpl which is used in some pages(meaning sometime you need to give to parser sometimes not).
- syntax is ugly. It should be beautiful to write template.
- limited numbers of function/operations.
Better option is to use pongo2.

##[June 20th]
Template override:
- override rule can have more readability than pure include with condition, because condition is defined clearly in config file. And much easier to maintain when there are many templates.
- better to invoke template overriding from template using include because then template override can be more powerful in between(not go is involved in rendering).
- override should support multiple folders(design).
- override should be scriptable, meaning for multisite, they can share a design and also possible to extend template.
- base is overridable also.

Most important thing is to have a balance between pongo2 extend, include and override:
- If some parts is changable, use extend(eg. base.html), but entry will be from actual template. So block should be predefined when extending.(like oo extend but the invoke is from child)
- multi level extend: it happens when you want to inject between base and actual templates(eg. different side view).
- If template will be reused, but not changed. use include. entry will be from actual template.(like function invoke)
- override.yaml defines the entry template.
- override in extend? this shouldn't be used much, otherwise it will destroy the purpose of extend.
- override in include? easy to understand

Override in differet levels:
- base: layout, eg. top-main-bottom, contentonly
- middle: section. eg. full-layout, with-side-layout
- actual: folder. eg. folder-blog, folder-news
- include: eg. content-block. eg. folder-block, article-block.

should we change BaseDirectory for layout?
