This is just some doubts about go behavior
---------
Note: it is a personal option and it might be because the lack of knowledge/experience of go.
- Make it easier to judge empty struct. I understand struct instance is a value, but it will be helpful to have a simpler empty struct instance check. In OO you can check if( strVar == null ), or empty( $strVar ) in php, which in go,
    - it's like if strVar == Struct1{}, and
    - sometimes Struct1 can be very a long name. eg. if strVar == ContentFieldHandler{}, and sometimes the struct is not comparable at all(eg. when there is []string inside), and then you need you check what's inside, and then
    - sometime inside field of a struct is not reliable, and you need to create a new field similar IsEmtpy and maintain that!
- Make interface implementing declared. Would be better for code check.
- Embed code generation. Code generation is good and important feature when there is no class loader. It would make code more readable if you can invoke code generating from code and embed the generated code to the same file.
