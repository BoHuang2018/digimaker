Editorial UI
---------
Principle ideas of editorial UI
- EUI has 3 possible places to run: frontend, independent, project(eg crm). In project either EUI embed project or project embed EUI(this way will be interesting :)).
- can be hooked into frontend(with scope), and also can be a separate site. It will be up to project(eg. config file/startup script) to set to hook into frontend site or not.
- UI supports inline editing with frontend design. In this case some inline class(eg. content-title, content-body) is needed for EUI to do inline editing.
- Inline editing will be a kind of "extending preview feature".
