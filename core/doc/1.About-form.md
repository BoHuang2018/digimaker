Form
---------
The form should be treated the same as "content editting". Because of the minimal design of content field, we can treat form almost equal to normal content. - so almost most of the apis and feature in content model can be used in form. eg. Field type, handler api. Permission setting to read form data even for end users.

Form is a typical "developement senario" for content model, a good content model should make form easy&powerful(reuse things from content model automatically)
 

So the content operation term will need to change. 
- Publish should be called Create since for form, publish is not a good term
- Draft sometimes is needed, sometimes not to balance simplicity/performance and feature.
