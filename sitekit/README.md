DM Sitekit
==========
Sitekit is a toolkit which provides apis to build sites based on dm content framework.

### Core features

- multi sites support
- load multi sites from yaml config file or api, or both.
- powerful template override based on conditions
- nice url(from niceurl package)
- route which can be integrate with other route by using sub route

### Template engine
For now the primary template engine is pongo2.

There is idea to support different template engines for different purpose(eg. pre-compiled template engine for performance sensitive case).

See [Demosite](../demosite) for example use.
